# MarksEmailer
Python Automation to Fetch the Marks from an Excel Sheet and E-Mail everyone their marks respectively. Sends 1000+ emails in less than a few minutes.

NOTE:
- The code can be modified to attach attachments
- Send mass emails with other sort of data other than just individual mark sheet.

Important Points:
- 2FA Needs to be disabled while using the program
- Ensure you have "All Less Secure App Access" in case you're using G-Mail (Since we use SMTP Protcol)
- There might be chances in the port numbers if you use other email providers.
